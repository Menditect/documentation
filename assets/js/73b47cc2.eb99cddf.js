We could add a documentation field on the execution user for this purpose so that you can indicate which user it is with an ID.\nIn this case, we are testing on behalf of an SSO user, but not testing SSO itself. Unfortunately, this is not really easy to automate, because SSO often requires credentials to be entered each time and we would rather not store them in Menditect. Furthermore, if 2-factor authentication has been set up, it is of course not easy to test in an automated way, because the token is then generated somewhere else and we cannot solve this in Menditect anyway.\nWhat could possibly be done for API users with SSO is that an app-specific user/password is created so that we can then give that user to test cases that test an API. However, not all SSO systems support that, so we would have to find that out for you."),(0,i.kt)("h2",{id:"connectiviteitstesten"},"Connectiviteitstesten"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"MTA can be used to test connectivity by calling an API.
