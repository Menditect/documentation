The receiving Party and its Representatives shall use such Confidential Information only for the purpose for which it was disclosed and shall not use or exploit such Confidential Information for the benefit of another without the prior written consent of the disclosing Party. Each Party accepts responsibility for the actions of its Representatives and shall protect the other Party’s Confidential Information in the same manner as it protects its own valuable confidential information, but in no event, shall less than reasonable care be used.

Unless expressly stated otherwise, (a) Licensee and/or its Affiliates is and shall remain the data controller of the Licensee Data (which, for the purposes of this Agreement, may include personal data / personally identifiable information it uploads, stores or provides as part of the services under this Agreement, as the case may be), and (b) Menditect is a service provider to Licensee that is and shall remain the data processor of the same, as defined in the DPA.

In this respect Licensee consents that Licensee Data may be processed, hosted and stored from locations either in the United States (by default for customers domiciled in the United States, Canada or a country in Central or South America or the Caribbean) or Europe (by default for customers domiciled elsewhere than in the aforementioned countries), in accordance with the above requirements.</p><p>7.6. <em>Organization Level Security Measures</em>.

Menditect evaluates and responds to incidents that create suspicion of unauthorized access to or handling of Licensee Data (“Incident”). Menditect is informed of such Incidents and, depending on the nature of the activity, defines escalation paths and response teams to address those Incidents. Menditect will work with Licensee and, where necessary, with outside law enforcement to respond to the Incident. The goal of the Incident response will be to restore the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the services, and to establish root causes and remediation steps. For purposes of this section 7.8, “Security Breach” means the misappropriation of Licensee Data located on Menditect systems that compromises the security, confidentiality or integrity of such information. Menditect will inform Licensee within 36 hours if Menditect determines that Licensee Data has been subject to a Security Breach (including by a Menditect employee) or any other circumstance in which Licensee is required to provide a notification under applicable law, unless otherwise required by law. Menditect will promptly investigate the Security Breach and take reasonable measures to identify its root cause(s) and prevent a recurrence. As information is collected or otherwise becomes available, unless prohibited by law, Menditect will provide Licensee with a description of the Security Breach, the type of data that was the subject of the breach, and other information Licensee may reasonably request concerning the affected persons. The Parties agree to coordinate in good faith on developing the content of any related public statements or any required notices for the affected persons and/or the relevant data protection authorities.</p><p>7.8. <em>Data Portability</em>.

Excluded from Menditect’ above indemnification obligations are claims to the extent arising from: (i) use of the Menditect Application(s) and Documentation in violation of this Agreement or applicable law; (ii) continued use by Licensee of the Menditect Application(s) and Documentation after Menditect has notified Licensee in writing to cease the use of the Menditect Application(s) and Documentation; (iii) any claim relating to any third-party products or services or Licensee Data; (iv) modifications to the Menditect Application(s) and Documentation made other than by Menditect (where the claim would not have arisen but for such modification); (v) the combination, operation, or use of the Menditect Application(s) with software or equipment which was not provided by Menditect, to the extent that Licensee’s liability for such claim would have been avoided in the absence of such combination, operation, or use; or (vi) compliance by Menditect with Licensee’s custom requirements or specifications if and to the extent such compliance with Licensee’s custom requirements or specifications resulted in the infringement.

The indemnified Party shall: (i) promptly notify the indemnifying Party in writing of any claim, suit, action, or proceeding for which indemnity is claimed, provided that failure to so notify will not remove the indemnifying Party’s obligation except to the extent it is prejudiced thereby, and (ii) allow the indemnifying Party to solely control the defense of any Claim and all negotiations for settlement, provided that the indemnifying Party shall not settle any Claim that imposes a financial obligation or admission of liability or guilt on the indemnified Party without the indemnified Party’s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The indemnified Party shall also provide the indemnifying Party with reasonable cooperation and assistance in defending such claim, at the indemnifying Party’s cost, however the indemnified Party shall bear all costs of engaging its own counsel.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="9-general-provisions">9 General Provisions<a class="hash-link" href="#9-general-provisions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>9.1. <em>Export Compliance</em>.
