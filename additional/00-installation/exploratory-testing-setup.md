# MTA Exploratory Free Edition Setup Guide

Welcome to the **Menditect Test Automation (MTA) Exploratory Free Edition**.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure and run AI-assisted exploratory testing on your local Mendix application **without requiring a paid MTA Cloud license**.

MTA Exploratory provides in-memory test execution directly inside your running Mendix Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When your AI assistant executes an exploratory test:
1. It creates test objects and parameters in-memory.
2. It executes your target microflows with isolated test payloads.
3. It automatically rolls back database transactions (`RollbackTcseAfterExecution: Yes`), keeping your application data clean.
4. It analyzes runtime telemetry (variable values, return data, execution times, and rule evaluations) and presents immediate results.

---

## Choose Your Setup Path

The **MTA Runtime Plugin** is required for all setups. You can choose how your AI assistant interacts with your Mendix application:

## Common Step: Install and Configure the MTA Plugin in Studio Pro

The MTA Plugin embeds a lightweight, secure Model Context Protocol (MCP) server directly inside your running Mendix application. This step is identical for both variants.

### 1. Download and Import the MTA Plugin Module
1. In Mendix Studio Pro, open the **Marketplace** (or visit the public [Menditect Test Automation Plugin component (Marketplace Component 214717)](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/214717)).
2. Download and import the MTA Plugin module into your Mendix project.

   Ensure you are using a version that includes the embedded MCP server:
   * **Mendix 9:** Version **`9.5.3`** or higher
   * **Mendix 10:** Version **`10.5.3`** or higher
   * **Mendix 11:** Version **`11.5.3`** or higher

3. If prompted, ensure standard module dependencies (such as `CommunityCommons`) are updated.

### 2. Configure MTA Plugin Constants
In Mendix Studio Pro App Explorer, open `App > Marketplace modules > MtaPluginModule > Constants` (or configure them under `Settings > Configurations > Edit > Constants`):

| Constant Name | Value | Description and Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`MtaPluginModule.ApplicationInstanceToken`** | `{YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN}` | Paste the personal token provided in your Menditect welcome email. |
| **`MtaPluginModule.ConnectionMethod`** | `AfterStartup` | Connects the plugin automatically whenever the application starts. |
| **`MtaPluginModule.EnableMcpServer`** | `True` | Activates the local `/plugin/mcp` endpoint for your AI assistant. |
| **`MtaPluginModule.MTAConnectionUrl`** | `wss://services.menditect.com` | The Menditect connection WebSocket gateway URL. |
| **`MtaPluginModule.MTAConnectionUsername`** | `MTAConnectionUser` | Default username for the plugin connection. |
| **`MtaPluginModule.MTAConnectionPassword`** | `c0Nn3cT-mTa-PlUg1n!` | Default password for the connection gateway. |
| **`MtaPluginModule.McpServerAccessToken`** | *(Choose your own secret key)* | e.g. `MySecretToken123`. This secret token protects your local MCP endpoint from unauthorized access. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make note of the secret value you enter for **`MtaPluginModule.McpServerAccessToken`**. You will provide this token to your AI assistant / workspace configuration.

### 3. Verify Startup Microflow
If your project already defines an *After Startup* microflow under **App > Settings > Runtime**:
* Open your existing After Startup microflow.
* Add a microflow call activity to execute `MtaPluginModule.ASU_Setup_Connection_MTA`.

### 4. Start Your Application Locally
* Press **F5** (or click **Run Locally**) in Studio Pro.
* Ensure the application starts cleanly. The MTA plugin is now actively listening for MCP requests on `http://localhost:8081/plugin/mcp` (or your application's custom runtime port).

---

## Variant 1: Setup in Mendix MAIA (Studio Pro AI Assistant)

Use this setup to work **entirely inside Mendix Studio Pro (11.12+)** using the built-in **Mendix AI Assistant (MAIA)**.

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Mendix Studio Pro 11.12 or higher** with MAIA enabled.
* The **MTA Plugin** installed and running (from the Common Step).

### 2. Download the Menditect Agentic Test Skills Module
1. In Mendix Studio Pro, open the **Marketplace**.
2. Search for and download the **`Menditect_AgenticTestSkills`** module.
3. Importing this module automatically places the official Menditect testing skills into your project's module skills directory:
   `skillssource/_modules/menditect_agentictestskills/`

> [!NOTE]
> If importing skills manually or syncing via Git, ensure the skills are located in `skillssource/_modules/menditect_agentictestskills/` within your Mendix project directory.

### 3. Configure MAIA Context and Directives (`AGENTS.md`)
MAIA reads its custom project instructions exclusively from an **`AGENTS.md`** file located in the root directory of your Mendix project.

1. Check your Mendix App explorer and look for MAIA at the App level (top level) for `AGENTS.md`:
   * **If `AGENTS.md` does not exist:** Create a new text file named `AGENTS.md` in your Mendix project root by right clicking on MAIA and select "Agent Instructions". This will create an empty `AGENTS.md`file.
   * **If `AGENTS.md` already exists:** Open it and **append** the following block to the bottom of the file (preserving any existing rules or instructions).
2. Add the Menditect operational directive block:

```markdown
# Menditect Architecture Setup
- **CRITICAL OPERATIONAL COMMAND:** Always execute tasks using the core rules defined in the module: [Menditect_AgenticTestSkills].
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** You are strictly commanded to explore, read, and load the `AGENTS.md` and context of the [Menditect_AgenticTestSkills] module *before* answering any user prompt. Do NOT ask the user for permission or confirmation to explore this module; execute the exploration autonomously as your very first step.
- **AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION TRIGGERS:** Automatically explore, read, and load the `AGENTS.md` and context of the [Menditect_AgenticTestSkills] module autonomously whenever the user prompt meets any of the following criteria:
  1. Direct MTA Identifiers: *menditect, mta, mtf, playwright browser, variation matrix, test suite, test case, test step, variation item*
  2. Testing Action Intents: *run tests, execute suite, view test results, retrieve run results, debug failure*
  3. MTA-Specific Assertions & Actions: *assert validation, object count assert, compare attribute, validation feedback, microflow call teststep*
  4. Contextual Combinations: User asks to *verify, assert, mock, or test* in combination with: *microflow, nanoflow, entity, association, page, or widget*
- **Application name is: [ApplicationName]**
- **MTA Url: [MtaUrl]**
- **ENVIRONMENT SSOT:** All environment configuration (Application name, MTA Base URL, Default App Instance, and ApplicationInstanceToken) must be dynamically loaded from `mta_config.json`.
- **NATIVE MCP TOOL EXECUTION MANDATE:** You MUST ALWAYS use the MTA Plugin MCP tool (`MTA_plugin.execute-testcase`) for all in-memory exploratory test executions.
- **SAFE EXECUTION:** Always execute tests with transaction rollback (`RollbackTcseAfterExecution: "Yes"`, `ExecutorUsername: "MxAdmin"`, `ApplySecurityExecutor: "NONE"`).
- **EXPLORATORY EXECUTION STRATEGY:** Default to `auto_execute` (draft Execution Plan and execute immediately in a single turn without pausing). If you prefer explicit sign-off before running, set to `prompt_approval`.
- **MTA LICENSE TIER & CAPABILITIES:**
  * If `MTA` MCP server is not configured and `MtaPluginModule.MTAConnectionUrl` is `wss://services.menditect.com`, the user is operating under the **Free MTA Exploratory License**.
  * **Free Capabilities:** Unlimited local in-memory microflow testing (`execute-testcase`) and local Execution Plan generation (`EP_*.md`).
  * **Paid Platform Capabilities:** Persistent cloud/on-prem test suites, Playwright Frontend UI testing, and CI/CD automated regression pipelines require a paid MTA Platform License.
- **MCP SUBPROCESS PROTECTION & TOKEN ROTATION:** NEVER execute terminal commands (`Stop-Process`, `taskkill`, `kill`) against running MCP server/proxy processes (`mta-proxy.js`, `node.exe`, or custom proxies). Terminating stdio child processes causes AI IDEs (Antigravity, Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code) to permanently disable MCP servers for the active session. The built-in proxy reloads `.env` dynamically on every request with zero restart needed. If using a static or custom proxy that returns HTTP 401, prompt the user to update their credentials and use their IDE's "Restart MCP Server" / "Reload Window" UI action.
```

3. Configure your **ExecutorUsername:** By default, test execution runs under the `MxAdmin` user  context. If `MxAdmin` is not present in your Mendix app's user database, you can specify a different existing administrator or test username (e.g. `ExecutorUsername: "Admin"` or `ExecutorUsername: "TestUser"`) in your `AGENTS.md` directives, see step 2 above.

4. Set the **EXPLORATORY EXECUTION STRATEGY:** Default to `auto_execute` (draft Execution Plan and execute immediately in a single turn without pausing). If you prefer explicit sign-off before running, set to `prompt_approval`.

### 4. Connect MAIA to the Local MTA Plugin MCP Server
Configure MAIA's MCP tool settings in Studio Pro (or within your environment MCP configuration), see https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/maia-mcp/#adding-server:

* **Server Name:** `MTA_plugin`
* **URL:** `http://localhost:[YourPort]/plugin/mcp`)
* **Connection type:** `HTTP`
* **Authentication:** `Bearer Token`: use the exact value set in `MtaPluginModule.McpServerAccessToken`

> [!TIP]
> Don't forget to enable the `execute-testcase` tool in the MCP Settings pane.

### 5. Execute an Exploratory Test in MAIA
1. Ensure your Mendix app is running (**F5**).
2. Open the **MAIA Chat** panel inside Mendix Studio Pro.
3. Prompt MAIA:

```text
Using the Menditect Agentic Test Skills module, execute an exploratory test for microflow MyModule.SUB_CalculateDiscount on my running app. Verify boundary conditions and check return values.
```

4. **MAIA Execution Process:**
   * MAIA reads the microflow directly from your active Studio Pro model.
   * It composes the in-memory test payload (`TCEX_RQ`) following the patterns in `Menditect_AgenticTestSkills`.
   * It sends the request to the local MTA Plugin MCP server (`execute-testcase`).
   * The microflow executes in the JVM and rolls back immediately.
   * MAIA displays the execution telemetry, step durations, and verified return values in the chat.

## Variant 2: Setup via Agentic Test Workspace (External AI IDE)

Use this setup to write and run tests using external AI IDEs such as **Cursor**, **VS Code (GitHub Copilot / Cline)**, **Google Antigravity / Gemini**, or **Claude Code**.

The **[agentic-test-workspace](https://github.com/Menditect/agentic-test-workspace/blob/main/README.md)** is a pre-configured tools workspace that orchestrates Menditect testing skills, offline model inspection, and local MCP tool bridging for AI coding assistants.

### Why Use the Agentic Test Workspace?
* **Multi-IDE Automation:** Automatically configures MCP tool definitions, security permissions, and agent directives for Cursor (`.cursor/mcp.json`), VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`), Claude Code (`.claude/settings.json`), and Google Antigravity (`mcp_config.json`) with zero manual JSON editing.
* **Offline Model Search & AST Analysis (`mxcli`):** Includes a built-in Mendix model indexer (`mxcli`) that converts your `.mpr` project file into an optimized local SQLite catalog (`.mxcli/catalog.db`). This allows AI assistants to perform sub-second microflow lookups, trace callers/callees, and inspect domain models completely offline.
* **Zero Git Clutter:** The dedicated tools workspace operates in an isolated directory alongside your Mendix project, keeping your core Mendix Git repository completely clean of test scripts, logs, and local tokens.
* **Dynamic MCP Token Bridging:** Embeds a local proxy (`mta-proxy.js`) that connects stdio-based AI IDEs to the running Mendix runtime's HTTP MCP endpoint, dynamically reloading tokens from `.env` without requiring IDE restarts.

For in-depth architecture details and command references, see the **[agentic-test-workspace README](https://github.com/Menditect/agentic-test-workspace/blob/main/README.md)**.

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Node.js (v18+)** installed.
* **Git** installed.

### 2. Create and open your workspace directory

Create a dedicated folder for your workspace on your local disk and navigate into it:

```
# Create your workspace directory (replace 'C:\projects\your-workspace' with your preferred path)
mkdir C:\projects\your-workspace

# Navigate into the newly created workspace directory
cd C:\projects\your-workspace
```

### 3. Clone the repository

Clone the `agentic-test-workspace` repository inside your workspace directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Menditect/agentic-test-workspace.git
```

### 4. Go to agentic-test-workspace directory

Navigate into the cloned repository folder:

```bash
cd agentic-test-workspace
```

### 5. Run the Setup Wizard
Run the interactive setup script:

```bash
npm run setup
```

Follow the prompts step-by-step:

1. **Accept Disclaimer:** Press **Enter** to accept `y`.
2. **Workspace Option:** Choose `[1] Dedicated Tools Workspace (Recommended)` to keep your Mendix project repository clean.
3. **Local Mendix App Path:** Enter the path to your Mendix project (e.g. `C:\Users\YourName\Mendix\MyApp`). The wizard will detect your `.mpr` file and Mendix version automatically.
4. **Model Inspection Source:** Select `[1] mxcli (recommended)`. This allows the AI to inspect microflows and domain models offline.
5. **Project Search Index:** Select `[1] Fast (recommended)` to compile the SQLite catalog (`.mxcli/catalog.db`) in seconds.
6. **MTA Application Instances (Cloud Execution):** When asked *"Do you have an MTA Application Instance to configure? (y/n)"*, enter `n`. *(Exploratory testing runs locally and does not require cloud instances).*
7. **Application Name:** Press **Enter** to accept the detected project name.
8. **MTA URL:** Default is `https://services.menditect.com`. *(Note: For free exploratory users, the cloud MTA URL is not relevant because all testing runs locally on your machine. You can safely press **Enter** to accept the default or leave it empty).*
9. **Identification token for a service account:** **Press Enter to SKIP (leave blank).** *(You do not need an MTA Cloud license or service account token for exploratory testing).*
10. **App Under Test Plugin URL:** Press **Enter** to accept `http://localhost:[YourPort]/plugin/mcp` (or enter your custom port if different).
11. **App Under Test Plugin Token:** Enter `Bearer ` followed by the secret token you chose in Studio Pro for `MtaPluginModule.McpServerAccessToken` (e.g. `Bearer MySecretToken123`).
12. **Exploratory Execution Strategy (`exploratory_execution_mode`):**
    * Choose `[1] auto_execute (recommended)`: High-velocity 1-turn testing. The AI writes the complete Execution Plan (`EP_*.md`) to disk and dispatches the test immediately in the **very same turn** (< 3 seconds total feedback). Transactions are safely rolled back in memory, and the test plan remains on disk ready for permanent promotion to MTA at any time.
    * Choose `[2] prompt_approval`: Traditional governed flow. The AI drafts the Execution Plan and pauses at **Checkpoint 1**, waiting for your explicit approval before executing.
13. **Review & Confirm Configuration:** The wizard displays your complete configuration summary (including setting `mta_license_tier` to `free_exploratory` / `auto`). Type `9` if you wish to toggle the exploratory mode, or press **Enter** (`y`) to confirm and write `mta_config.json` and `.env`.
14. **Verify the Setup:** The wizard automatically verifies the setup and configuration of the MTA Plugin MCP server as the final step.

>[TIP!]
> Make sure the app is running in StudioPro



You can also **Verify the Setup Manually** at any time. 
 
Execute from the agentic-test-workspace directory in your workspace:

```bash
npm run verify
```

The verify tool will confirm:
* `mta_config.json` and `.env` are properly structured.
* `mxcli` offline model inspection is active.
* Local `MTA_plugin` MCP endpoint is reachable and authenticated.


### 6. Open Your AI IDE and Execute Your First Test
1. Open the parent workspace directory (e.g. `C:\projects\mta-workspace`) in **Cursor**, **VS Code**, or **Antigravity** (or run `claude` in that directory).
2. All MCP configurations (`.cursor/mcp.json`, `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`) and agent directives (`AGENTS.md`) are automatically loaded. 
3. You can instruct your AI assistant to configure its own MCP server settings dynamically by using this prompt:
```bash
Read `mta_config.json` and `.env` in this workspace, and configure your MCP client settings to connect to the`mta_plugin` server (`plugin_mcp_url`) using the corresponding Bearer token.
``` 
4. Once the MTA Plugin MCP server is properly configured, prompt your assistant in the chat:

```text
Please inspect the microflow MyModule.SUB_CalculateDiscount using mxcli, 
and execute an exploratory unit test with all boundary values on my running app using the MTA_plugin tool.
```

## How Exploratory Test Execution Works

Regardless of whether you use **Variant 1 (MAIA)** or **Variant 2 (Agentic Workspace)**, the underlying exploratory execution engine operates under the same protocol:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User as Developer
    participant AI as AI Assistant (MAIA / IDE)
    participant Model as Mendix Model (Studio Pro / mxcli)
    participant Plugin as MTA Plugin (:8081/plugin/mcp)
    participant JVM as Mendix JVM Runtime

    User->>AI: "Test microflow SUB_CalculateDiscount"
    AI->>Model: Inspect parameters and return types
    Model-->>AI: Parameter: Order (OrderTotal: Decimal), Returns: Decimal
    Note over AI: Writes EP_SUB_CalculateDiscount.md to disk
    alt exploratory_execution_mode == auto_execute (Default)
        AI->>Plugin: Immediate call execute-testcase (same turn)
    else exploratory_execution_mode == prompt_approval
        AI->>User: Present Checkpoint 1 (Pause for Approval)
        User->>AI: "Approved / Proceed"
        AI->>Plugin: call execute-testcase
    end
    Plugin->>JVM: Open isolated transaction
    JVM->>JVM: Create mock Order in-memory
    JVM->>JVM: Execute SUB_CalculateDiscount
    JVM->>JVM: Capture return value (e.g. 15.00)
    JVM->>JVM: Rollback transaction (Zero DB writes)
    JVM-->>Plugin: Return runtime telemetry (TCEX_RS)
    Plugin-->>AI: Return JSON result (Duration: 12ms, Output: 15.00)
    AI-->>User: Formatted test report + clickable plan link
```

### Execution Strategy & Plan Governance (`exploratory_execution_mode`)
Even in free exploratory testing, Menditect ensures complete testing hygiene through structured Execution Plans:
* **The Universal Execution Plan Mandate:** Before executing any test via `execute-testcase`, the AI writes a complete, versioned Execution Plan (`EP_<Name>.md`) to disk containing the test scope, mock parameters, boundary variations, and expected assertions.
* **`auto_execute` (Default / Recommended):** The AI writes the plan to disk and triggers execution in the **very same turn**. You get instant test feedback (< 3 seconds total roundtrip) without manual approval pauses. Because the test plan is stored on disk, you can promote it to a permanent MTA test case at any time (`PAT-57`, `PAT-106`).
* **`prompt_approval`:** The AI writes the draft plan and halts at **Checkpoint 1**, requiring you to explicitly reply "Proceed" before it contacts the plugin MCP server.

### Key Request Safeguards in `TCEX_RQ`
* **`ExecutorUsername: "MxAdmin"`**: Provides the execution user context to the Mendix runtime. *(Note: If `MxAdmin` is not present in your Mendix user database, you can specify a different username—such as `Admin` or a designated test user—in your `AGENTS.md` directives).*
* **`ApplySecurityExecutor: "NONE"`**: Allows isolated unit testing without requiring active browser session logins.
* **`RollbackTcseAfterExecution: "Yes"`**: Guarantees test operations never leave dirty data in your local database.
* **`TCEX_RQ_AttributeValueRun`**: Injects mock attributes directly into memory before executing the microflow.

## Maintenance and Useful Commands Reference

| Task | Variant 1: MAIA | Variant 2: Agentic Workspace |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Verify Setup** | Check MAIA MCP server status indicator in Studio Pro | Run `npm run verify` in terminal |
| **Update Skills** | Update `Menditect_AgenticTestSkills` via Marketplace | Run `npm run update:skills` |
| **Re-index Model** | Automatic (MAIA reads live Studio Pro model) | Run `./mxcli -c "REFRESH CATALOG FULL FORCE;"` |
| **Check for Tool Updates** | Check Studio Pro Marketplace updates | Run `npm run update:check` |

---

## Troubleshooting

### 1. HTTP 401 Unauthorized from `MTA_plugin`
* **Cause:** The MCP access token configured in your IDE / MAIA does not match Studio Pro.
* **Solution:** Ensure `PLUGIN_MCP_TOKEN` in your `.env` (or MAIA MCP header) is set to `Bearer <YourToken>`, matching `MtaPluginModule.McpServerAccessToken`.

### 2. Connection Refused (`http://localhost:8081/plugin/mcp`)
* **Cause:** The Mendix application is not running or the MCP server is disabled.
* **Solution:**
  1. Make sure your app is running in Studio Pro (**F5**).
  2. Verify that constant `MtaPluginModule.EnableMcpServer` is set to `True`.
  3. If your Mendix app runs on a custom port (e.g. `8080`), change the port in your URL to `http://localhost:8080/plugin/mcp`.

### 3. Java Exception: `Executor Username or Executor UserRoles need to be given`
* **Cause:** The execution payload omitted the execution user, or the configured user does not exist in the database.
* **Solution:** The Menditect skills default to `"ExecutorUsername": "MxAdmin"` and `"ApplySecurityExecutor": "NONE"`. If `MxAdmin` is not present in your application, set your project's active administrator or test user (e.g. `ExecutorUsername: "Admin"`) in your `AGENTS.md` file.

### 4. Java Runtime Errors after installing / updating MTA Plugin
* **Cause:** Leftover or duplicate MTA Plugin `.jar` files in the project library folder after importing or updating the module.
* **Solution:**
  1. Open your local Mendix project directory in your file explorer.
  2. Navigate to the `userlib/` directory and remove any older or conflicting MTA Plugin `.jar` files (e.g., `mta-plugin-*.jar`).
  3. In Mendix Studio Pro, go to **App > Clean Deployment Directory** (or **Project > Clean Deployment Directory**).
  4. Restart and run your Mendix application from Studio Pro (**F5**).
