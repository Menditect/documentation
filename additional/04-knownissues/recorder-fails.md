# Recorder fails

## Issue summary

There can be multiple reasons why the recorder is failing:

- The Recorder uses information generated by Mendix to create teststeps. Due to a structural change in this information, **the Recorder does not work in Mendix runtime versions 9.24.4, 9.24.5, 9.24.6 and 9.24.7**. 
- It is possible that the recorder was started too late. Please start the recorder before logging in to the application.
