# Umbrella icon shows error

## Issue summary

After [running a complete Test Configuration](../../test-configuration#execute-a-test-configuration), you see an umbrella icon <i class="fal fa-umbrella"></i>.

Clicking on this icon shows a popup window called "Coverage for test run" and also an error is shown in another popup.

This is a bug in MTA where the "Coverage" feature that is still being developed, will be released in the future, accidentally already made it's way into the test run page. 

Except the error being shown, this will not affect other MTA functions.
