# Microflow list covers Close button

## Issue summary

When adding a Microflow Call teststep, the list of microflows that is shown covers the Close button on the bottom-right of the popup.

This is a known issue that will be fixed in a future release.

Click the "X" on the top right or press `Escape` on the keyboard to close the page without adding a Microflow Call teststep.
