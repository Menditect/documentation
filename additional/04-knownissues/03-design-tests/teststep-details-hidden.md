# Teststep details not showing

## Issue summary

In some cases the "Details of teststep" portion of the page is not correctly showing all attributes and associations of a Create/Change/Retrieve Teststep. 

The list of attributes or associations is only showing partially, broken off with a scrollbar, or not at all.

## Possible causes and resolutions

### Revision does not match

This occurs when navigating back and forth through Teststeps within the same Test Case for an extended period of time.

After some time, the browser no longer correctly displays the element that contains the attributes and associations.

**Resolution**

Re-select the Test Case.
