# Test Setting 

## Definition

A Test Setting can be chosen to run a [Test Configuration](test-configuration). The Test Setting defines which [Application Instance(s)](application-instance) will be used during a [Test Run](test-run).
The user that is logged in determines which Test Setting is to be selected when Executing the Test Configuration, by setting one as a Preference.

:::info
Test Settings are only relevant when [executing Test Configurations from within MTA](test-configuration#execute-a-test-configuration).<br/>
When using MTA's [Public API](api#post-execute-testconfiguration), an [Application Instance](application-instance) must be specified.
