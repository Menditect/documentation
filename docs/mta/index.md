# MTA

Menditect Test Automation (MTA) is a Mendix App, developed and maintained by Menditect, that can be used for Automated Testing other Mendix Apps. MTA can be hosted by Menditect in the Mendix cloud, or hosted by the customer, either in the cloud or on-premises. MTA uses information about the Mendix model, like microflows and entities, for test design. Test scripts are defined inside MTA but executed on an Instance of the Mendix App under test. Test Run Results can be viewed inside MTA, or downloaded into a separate BI tool by using the MTA API. 


# How to use

A page in the reference guide will always reference some element in MTA with that name.
Referenced elements in MTA are accompanied by a <i class="fal fa-question-circle"></i> button, that links to the relevant page in this guide.

Pages are structured in 4 segments:
- Definition: a description defining the element, why it exists and what it does.
- Properties: the attributes of the element in the MTA database, limited by how they occur in the MTA user interface.
- Business rules: rules as defined in the MTA application that apply to this element, excluding regular validation messages.
- Actions: actions that can be done with this element.
 
Actions are described with as few literal descriptions to page elements as possible. This means that sometimes buttons are visible on the page, but sometimes they are listed under a menu or overflow button.
