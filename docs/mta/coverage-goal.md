# Coverage Goal

## Definition

A Coverage Goal defines which microflows should at least be executed, when a **specific collection of tests** is executed. Microflows that are included in the goal, will count towards the coverage percentage in the [Coverage Calculation](coverage-calculation). 

To define the microflows usage in Coverage Calculation, a Coverage Goal can have one or more [Exclude Filters](coverage-exclude-filter). Microflows in the Mendix System module are always excluded from coverage calculation.

A Coverage Goal can be defined on a [Test Configuration](test-configuration), or on an [Application](application). When defining on a Test Configuration, create the **specific collection of tests**, by including [Test Suites](test-suite). When defining on an Application, create the **specific collection of tests**, by including [Test Configurations](test-configuration).


## Properties

### Name
The name of the coverage goal.

### Exclude Filters
The [Exclude Filters](coverage-exclude-filter) that determine the Coverage Goal.

### Test Suites
Defines which [Test Suites](test-suite) are included when calculating the Coverage Goal<br/> (only applicable for a Coverage Goal on a Test Configuration) 

### Test Configurations
Defines which [Test Configurations](test-configuration) are included when calculating the Coverage Goal<br/> (only applicable for a Coverage Goal on an Application)

## Business rules

- On a Coverage Goal that is defined on an Application, it is only possible to determine which microflows will be included based on the Exclude Filters, if at least 1 Test Configuration is included. 
- If no Test Configurations are included on a Coverage Goal that is defined on an Application, the Exclude Filters cannot be changed.
- Not including any Test Suites or Test Configurations on a Coverage Goal, will always lead to a 0 % coverage percentage.
- Defining Exclude Filters leading to 0 microflows being included in the Coverage Goal, will always lead to a 0 % coverage percentage.

## Actions on a Coverage Goal

:::info
After creating an Application or Test Configuration, a default Coverage Goal is created without Exclude Filters, <br/>including all microflows in the revision.
