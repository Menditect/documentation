# Test Suite 


## Definition

A Test Suite is an executable part of a [Test Configuration](test-configuration) and consists of a collection of [Test Cases](test-case) that are intended to be used to test a software program to show that it has some specified set of behaviours.

The Test Suite is the second level of the 4-layer framework that is used in MTA. It allows for a Test Configurations to be split up into different functional or technical aspects of the tested software. It is possible to define [Data Variation](datavariation) on the Test Suite level. 

## Properties

### Name
The name of the Test Suite.

### Description
A description of the Test Suite.

### Status
Can be either Changing or Ready. If Changing, this means MTA is updating the Test Suite because the user applied a new revision. If Ready, this means the Test Suite can be configured.
  
## Business rules

The [revision](application-revision) of all Applications used in the Test Suite must match the ones used in the Test Configuration.
