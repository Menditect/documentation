# Coverage Calculation

## Definition

A Coverage Calculation is a representation of the code coverage of one moment in time. It represents the coverage percentage of microflows that were executed, out of all included microflows for the associated [Coverage Goal](coverage-goal).  This Coverage Goal is **calculated** and stored as a Coverage Calculation, whenever a test is executed, "Coverage" was selected when starting the Test Run, and Coverage Goals exist. 

A Coverage Calculation can be associated to a [Test Configuration](test-configuration), or to an [Application](application).


## Properties
| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CalculationDate  | The date and time when the [Coverage Goal](coverage-goal) was calculated.                                                                  |
| App revision     | The [Application Revision](application-revision) that was used to evaluate and calculate the Coverage Goal.                                |
| Total #          | The total number of microflows in the App revision.                                                                                        |
| Excluded #       | The number of microflows that was excluded after evaluating the Coverage Goal.                                                             |
| Included #       | The number of microflows that was included after evaluating the Coverage Goal, <br/> and used to calculate the Coverage Goal.              |
| Executed excl. # | The number of microflows that were executed but not included in the Coverage Goal.                                                         |
| Executed incl. # | The number of microflows that were executed and included in the Coverage Goal.                                                             |
| Not executed #   | The number of microflows that were not executed.                                                                                           |
| Coverage %       | The coverage percentage (Executed incl devided by Included).                                                                               |
| Trend %          | The absolute difference in coverage percentage of this Calculation, <br/> compared to the previous Calculation for the same Coverage Goal. |



## Business rules
- A Coverage Calculation will only be created when executing a full [Test Configuration](test-configuration) and with "Coverage" enabled.
- A Coverage Calculation will only be created for [Test Runs](test-run) where the result is "Passed".
- A Coverage Calculation on an Application will be created for Test Runs in all Test Configurations that are included in the associated [Coverage Goal](coverage-goal), and only for Test Configurations on the latest [Application Revision](application-revision) found in these Test Configurations.
- A Coverage Calculation for Test Runs that were deleted, will only show Coverage % and Trend %. Other properties are no longer available then.
- For any [Application](application), only details for the 2 most recent Coverage Calculations will be kept in the cleanup process.
- Additionally, for any Application, the latest Coverage Calculation will also be kept, if the calculation was performed for a subset of included Test Configurations.
- For any Test Configuration, details of the Coverage Calculations will be kept if the associated Test Runs are not yet deleted.
