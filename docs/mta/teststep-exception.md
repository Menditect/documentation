# Teststep Exception


## Definition

A Teststep Exception occurs during the execution of a [Teststep](Teststep/). A Teststep Exception occurs because in the [Application Instance](application-instance) where the test was executed, a Mendix Error occured that was not handled by an [Error Handler](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/error-handling-in-microflows/).

A Teststep Exception can be handled by a [Teststep Exception Handler](Teststep#exception-handling).

A Teststep Exception is not to be confused with the [Coverage Exception](coverage-exception).
