# Snapshot

## Definition

A Snapshot is the condition of a [Test Configuration](test-configuration) that has been adapted to a certain [Application Revision](application-revision).

Before a Test Configuration is adapted, a Snapshot is created, to allow restoring to the condition before the adapt.

Restoring a Snapshot will only restore [Test Suites](test-suite), the [Test Runs](test-run) will remain in the original Test Configuration.

## Actions on Snapshot

### Create a Snapshot

A Snapshot is created automatically before the [Test Suites](test-suite) in a [Test Configuration](test-configuration) are adapted to an [Application Revision](application-revision).

### Restore a Snapshot

Restoring a Test Configuration using a snapshot will allow to **undo an Adapt**. 

- Navigate to "Test Configurations" in the top menu.
- Click <i class="fas fa-ellipsis"></i> and then <i class="fa-light fa-clock-rotate-left"></i> to restore a test configuration.

The result of this action will be:
- **A new [Test Configuration](test-configuration)** that is based on a previously selected [Application Revision](application-revision) is created and opened. <br/>It will be named `"Restored" - {timestamp} - {Original name}`. To change the name, [Edit](test-configuration#edit-a-test-configuration) the Test Configuration.
- **The original Test Configuration** will contain the executed [Test Runs](test-run). To view the executed Test Runs, open that Test Configuration.
