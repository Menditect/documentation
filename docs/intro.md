# Documentation

This is the home page for the Menditect Documentation site.

## Structure

- Use the [Reference guide](../reference-guide) to gain knowledge about topics in MTA. 
- Read [Release notes](../release-notes) to know what has changed since the last release. <br/>They are published together with every new version of MTA and describe all new features and fixed bugs. 
- The Additional section contains How to's for when you're stuck in MTA. 

Click on a topic or, on mobile devices, select the <svg width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 30 30" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2" d="M4 7h22M4 15h22M4 23h22"></path></svg> menu to browse through the site.
