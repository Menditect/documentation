# Application Instance

## Definition

Previously: *Application Environment*.<br/>
A single Mendix Application or 'app' that is deployed on a computer, for instance: Test, Acceptance or Production. 
To enable communication between MTA and this deployed app, the Application Instance's token that is generated upon creation must be entered in a Constant of this app.
The associated Execution setting on a Test Configuration determines which Application Instance is used to test on.

## Properties
| Name            | Description                                                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name            | The name of the Application Instance; the autogenerated Name is 'Default' but can be changed by the user. |
| Token           | A globally unique id (GUID) that is generated upon creation and identifies this instance.                 |
| Application URL | The URL to the instance that is entered by the user.                                                      |
| Connectiond Id  | A globally unique id (GUID) that is generated each time a connection is made to the instance.             |
