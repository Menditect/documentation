# Coverage Goal

## Definition

A Coverage Goal is used to define which microflows should at least be tested, when a Test Configuration is executed. These microflows will count towards the coverage percentage on the Test Run. A Coverage Goal is made up of one or more [Coverage Filters](coverage-filter), which define which microflows to exclude from calculating the coverage percentage.

A Coverage Goal can be defined on a [Test Configuration](test-configuration), or on an [Application](application).
