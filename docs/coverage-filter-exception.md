# Coverage Filter Exception

## Definition

A Coverage Filter Exception is used to include one or more microflows, that were excluded from the [Coverage Goal](coverage-goal) by a [Coverage Filter](coverage-filter).

A microflow that is included by an Exception, will always be added to the Coverage Goal, even if the filter that the Exception is associated to, excludes the same microflows.
