# MTA Scheduler Module

## Purpose

The purpose of this module is to enable customers who want to use the [MTA Public API](../mta/api) for scheduling the execution of tests in MTA.

It is meant to help customers setup their own CI/CD pipeline and to understand how the MTA Public API can be used to achieve this.

## Supported Versions

Menditect does **not** provide support for the MTA Scheduler Module.

The module is open-source and can be distributed and customized without limitations. 

## Installation instructions

The MTA Scheduler Module can be downloaded from the Mendix Marketplace.

It is currently in the private marketplace to prevent non-MTA users from downloading the Module.

[Contact Menditect Support](mailto:support@menditect.com) to get access.

## Update instructions

Click <i class="fa-regular fa-bookmark"></i> **Add to Saved** in the Mendix Marketplace to get notified about updates.

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies. The MTA Scheduler Module can be imported in a Mendix App that is under test of MTA, but this is not required.

Make sure to convert widgets to React widgets if [React](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/mendix-client/react/) is enabled for the Mendix project.

## Known issues

None.
