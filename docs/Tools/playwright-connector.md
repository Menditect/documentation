# Playwright Connector

## Purpose


The Playwright Connector makes it possible to define and run a frontend test from any Mendix App. It enables the App to connect to the Playwright server, based on specified connection settings, and execute the test. When executing a Frontend test, Playwright starts and hosts its own browser. This can be Chromium, Firefox or Webkit. In order to do this, Playwright needs to load required dependencies and, therefore, it needs the right permissions on the host server. In the image below, you can see how Playwright can be hosted on remote servers, either in the cloud or on a local server.


The Playwright Connector includes Locator microflows to find elements on a webpage, and Action microflows to click on elements, fill them with text, or select a value. Therefore it can be used to test *any* webapplication, not just Mendix Apps. Locator and Action microflows in the Playwright Connector can be defined and executed from MTA.
