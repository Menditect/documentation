# MTA Widget Finder

# Purpose

The MTA Widget Finder is used to prepare for building a Frontend test.

It is a browser extension that can be used in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox to determine the name of a [Mendix Widget](../mta/frontend-glossary#widget) on any [Mendix Page](../mta/mendix-page).

The name of a Widget is used to set the frontend test [Locator](../mta/frontend-glossary#locator). The MTA Widget Finder can be useful for debugging if a Locator fails.
