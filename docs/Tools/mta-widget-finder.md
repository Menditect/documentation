# MTA Widget Finder

## Purpose

The MTA Widget Finder is used to prepare for building a Frontend test.

It is a browser extension that can be used in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox to determine the name of a [Mendix Widget](../mta/frontend-glossary#widget) on any [Mendix Page](../mta/mendix-page).

The name of a Widget is used to set the frontend test [Locator](../mta/frontend-glossary#locator). The MTA Widget Finder can be useful for debugging if a Locator fails.

### Usage 

- On any [Mendix Page](../mta/mendix-page), activate the extension and hover the mouse over any [Mendix Widget](../mta/frontend-glossary#widget). 
- The Widget Finder will show the Widget name just next to the mouse cursor.
- Also, the Widget Finder will show a draggable black rectangle with (Count) information on how many times a Widget with this name occurs on this Page.
- Clicking `Shift` will 'lock' the currently highlighted Widget and show the option to Copy the Widget name and Page name to the clipboard. CLicking `Shift` again will 'unlock' the Widget.
