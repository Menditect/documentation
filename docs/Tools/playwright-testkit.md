# Playwright for Mendix Test Kit

## Purpose

The Playwright Test Kit is meant specifically to define and run Frontend tests for **Mendix Apps**. 

It contains Reusable Locator and Action microflows to test Mendix Platform Supported Widgets.

A few notes about the Frontend Test Kit:
- The Frontend Test Kit currently has the en-US and nl-NL languages built-in. 
- [React-enabled projects](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/mendix-client/react/) can be tested by setting the Constant IsUsingReactClient to True.
- Although more Widgets may be added as supported in the Frontend Test Kit, any changes made in the future can break Locating a Widget correctly.
