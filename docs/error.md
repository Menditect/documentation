# Error

## Definition

Errors in [Test Configurations](test-configuration) or in the [Test Settings](test-setting) are indicated by the "<font color="red"><i class="fas fa-circle-exclamation"></i></font>" icon. 

The cause of Errors can be different each time, but the result is always that a test cannot be executed.
