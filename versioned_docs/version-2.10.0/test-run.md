# Test Run 

## Definition

The Test Run contains the results of an executed [Test Case](test-case), [Test Suite](test-suite) or [Test Configuration](test-configuration).

The results are stored in subsequent Test Suite runs, Test Case runs and Teststep runs.

Regardless of the Scope of a Test Run, Test Suite runs, Test Case runs and Teststep runs are always created.

#### Cleanup of manually-executed Test Runs
In a Test Configuration, only the last two executed Test Runs are persisted overnight, plus a maximum of two pinned Test Runs. The rest is cleaned up. Read the [Pin a Test Run](#pin-a-test-run) section in this page for more information.

#### Cleanup of API-triggered Test Runs 
For Test Runs that are executed through the [Public API](api#post-execute-testconfiguration), instead of this, the Retention period applies. The date on which the Test Run will be deleted, is visible in the "Test runs" page.

#### Persisted dashboard data
If a Test Run is cleaned up, the following information about the Test Run is stored for the statistics on the dashboard page:
- start date
- result (Pas, Fail, Error)
- number of testcaseruns OK
- number of testcaseruns NOK
- number of testcaseruns not executed
- per Test Case run: Test Case name, application, environment, revision, Test Run result

### Pin a Test Run
Pinning a Test Run will prevent it from being cleaned up overnight.
- Navigate to the Test Run overview in MTA under Test Run.
- Click on <i class="fas fa-thumbtack"></i> next to the Test Run you want to keep.
